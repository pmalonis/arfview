Installation (Linux and OS X)
-----------------------------

A compiled stand-alone application for 64-bit Linux and OS X 10.9 can be downloaded from the releases page in this repository.


Building from source (Linux and OS X)
--------------------
  * Install [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).
  * In a new terminal window, install arfview:

        git clone https://github.com/kylerbrown/arfview.git

    sudo apt-get build-dep python-pyside python-h5py


Plot Checked Mode
-----------------

To plot multiple datasets across entries or files, click the "plot checked mode" button in the toolbar. Then check the datasets you want to plot, and click "Refresh Data View."  To select data based on attributes, select "Check Multiple" in the Tree toolbar.  Later versions will include the capability for more complex queries. 

Labeling
--------
To add a label to an existing label dataset, hold down a letter key and click on the plot.  A simple label with the name of the key pressed will be added to the plot at the location of the cursor on the time axis.  To label an interval, hold down shift and the letter key, click on the plot at the start time of the label, and then click again at the stop time.  

To add a label dataset, select the entry where you want the label to be added, and press the "Add Label" button on the main toolbar. 

Exporting data
--------------

The "Export Data" tool allows you to export a selected dataset as a .wav or .csv file.
